  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a clear and working blog post and site.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No as I still have the old format but I'm now getting the hang of it.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could spend more time on my github rather than helping others around me. I could have used JS bin to check to see whether my code works as github takes a long time to make changes.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I can try and add things by myself and don't copy the ones of the website. Using the resources that have been given to me can help speed up my work speed and help me develop more</td>
